### üì± Preview

Currently, the app looks like this on platforms:


---

## Built with 

- [Kotlin](kotlinlang.org): Programming language
- [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html): For building multi-platform applications in the single codebase.
- [Compose Resource](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-resources.html): 
Compose Resource is a structured approach for managing and accessing UI resources (such as strings, colors, and images) in Jetpack Compose across multiple platforms. When used in conjunction with libraries like Moko Resources, it allows for a unified and type-safe way to work with localized and platform-specific assets in Kotlin Multiplatform projects. This setup ensures that resources are accessible in a Compose-friendly way across Android, iOS, macOS, the JVM, and JS (Browser), with full support for system localization and consistent design.
-  [Compose Image Loader](https://github.com/qdsfdhvh/compose-imageloader): Compose Image library for Kotlin Multiplatform.

## Project structure 

This Compose Multiplatform project includes:

### [`composeApp`](/composeApp)
This is a Kotlin module that contains the common UI/logic for both Android and iOS applications, the code you share between platforms.
This shared module is also where you write your Compose Multiplatform code. In `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.
It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`. The shared module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.
